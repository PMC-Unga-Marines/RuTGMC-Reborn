/*
NOTES:
There is a DB table to track ckeys and associated discord IDs.
This system REQUIRES TGS, and will auto-disable if TGS is not present.
The SS uses fire() instead of just pure shutdown, so people can be notified if it comes back after a crash, where the SS wasn't properly shutdown
It only writes to the disk every 5 minutes, and it won't write to disk if the file is the same as it was the last time it was written. This is to save on disk writes
The system is kept per-server (EG: Terry will not notify people who pressed notify on Sybil), but the accounts are between servers so you dont have to relink on each server.

##################
# HOW THIS WORKS #
##################

ROUNDSTART:
1] The file is loaded and the discord IDs are extracted
2] A ping is sent to the discord with the IDs of people who wished to be notified
3] The file is emptied

MIDROUND:
1] Someone usees the notify verb, it adds their discord ID to the list.
2] On fire, it will write that to the disk, as long as conditions above are correct

END ROUND:
1] The file is force-saved, incase it hasn't fired at end round

This is an absolute clusterfuck, but its my clusterfuck -aa07
